# Stock Trend Prediction with LSTM

## Overview

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It leverages Streamlit to create an interactive web interface for visualizing predictions and stock trends.

## Key Features

    Downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
    Preprocesses data using MinMaxScaler.
    Trains an LSTM model with multiple layers and dropout for regularization.
    Displays descriptive statistics and visualizations of the stock data.
    Generates predictions for future stock prices.
    Shows a visual comparison of predicted vs. actual prices.
