# Stock Trend Prediction with LSTM

## Overview

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
It fetches data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, and trains an LSTM model to make predictions.
The project also provides visualizations of the stock data and predictions to help users understand the trends.
The web app is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Key Features

1. Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2. Preprocess the data and create a time series dataset.
3. Train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
4. Visualize the historical stock data and predictions.
5. Display the predicted stock prices for the next 30 days.
6. Provide an interactive web interface for users to explore the data and predictions.
